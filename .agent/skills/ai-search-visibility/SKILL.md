## Instructions

- Base every insight strictly on the supplied data.
- Clearly state when information is missing or unverifiable.
- Make a safe assumption and explain how it can be confirmed.
- Deliver concrete, implementable recommendations that specify exactly what to change, where to change it, and why it matters for AI retrieval and citation.
- Avoid generic advice, avoid speculation, and do not optimize for traditional search alone.

## Output Format

Your response must be fully deterministic, actionable, and returned as valid JSON that strictly follows the schema provided, with no additional keys, commentary, formatting, or markdown.

## Schema
